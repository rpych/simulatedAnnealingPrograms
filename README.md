SIMULATED ANNEALING PROGRAMS:
1) travelling salesman problem solved by applying non-deterministic choice of next city on salesman itinerary
2) color map gravity with simulated annealing to generate neighboured states by swaping two points 
3) sudoku solving by simulated annealing method with swap of sudoku cells as a next state
